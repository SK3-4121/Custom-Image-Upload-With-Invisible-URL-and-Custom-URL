# Custom Image Upload With Invisible URL and Custom URL And Custom HTML Portal Webpage (Open Source)
# V2 - V1 sucks no cap
Invisible URL: Invisible URL ex: "https://example.com/" and the image pops up in a embed without putting the image.png part at the end

Custom URL: Custom URL works as instead of making it go to "https://example.com/" and it pops up the image in a embed you can paste in your own url ex: "https://fbi.gov/" and it will still upload the image with a embed

Custom HTML Portal Webpage: You goto the home dir and it will give you a portal to see the last uploaded image
